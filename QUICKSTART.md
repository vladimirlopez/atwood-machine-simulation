# Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Open the Simulation
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. That's it! No installation needed.

### 2. Adjust Parameters
Use the controls to set:
- **Mass 1**: Weight of the left object (in kg)
- **Mass 2**: Weight of the right object (in kg)  
- **Initial Velocity**: Starting velocity (positive = Mass 1 moves down)

### 3. Run the Simulation
- Click **Start** to begin
- Click **Pause** to freeze
- Click **Reset** to restart

## üìä Understanding the Display

### Visual Elements
- **Blue block (M‚ÇÅ)**: Mass 1 (left side)
- **Red block (M‚ÇÇ)**: Mass 2 (right side)
- **Green arrows (v)**: Velocity vectors
- **Orange dashed arrows (a)**: Acceleration vectors

### Real-time Metrics
- **Acceleration**: How quickly velocity changes (m/s¬≤)
- **Current Velocity**: Speed and direction of motion (m/s)
- **Tension**: Force in the rope (Newtons)
- **Time**: Elapsed simulation time (seconds)

## üéì Teaching Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Motion
**Goal**: Demonstrate that heavier mass accelerates down
- Set: m‚ÇÅ = 2 kg, m‚ÇÇ = 4 kg, v‚ÇÄ = 0 m/s
- Result: M‚ÇÇ accelerates downward at 3.27 m/s¬≤

### Scenario 2: Counterintuitive Motion
**Goal**: Show acceleration ‚â† direction of motion
- Set: m‚ÇÅ = 2 kg, m‚ÇÇ = 3 kg, v‚ÇÄ = -4 m/s
- Result: M‚ÇÅ moves down initially, but acceleration points up!
- Watch: Eventually motion reverses to match acceleration

### Scenario 3: Equilibrium
**Goal**: Demonstrate constant velocity with equal masses
- Set: m‚ÇÅ = 3 kg, m‚ÇÇ = 3 kg, v‚ÇÄ = 2 m/s
- Result: Zero acceleration, constant velocity maintained

### Scenario 4: Extreme Difference
**Goal**: Show effect of large mass difference
- Set: m‚ÇÅ = 1 kg, m‚ÇÇ = 10 kg, v‚ÇÄ = 0 m/s
- Result: Rapid acceleration (‚âà8 m/s¬≤)

## üîç Key Physics Concepts

### 1. Acceleration vs Velocity
- **Velocity** = current speed and direction
- **Acceleration** = rate of change of velocity
- They can point in opposite directions!

### 2. Net Force
The heavier mass creates a net force:
- If m‚ÇÇ > m‚ÇÅ: system accelerates with m‚ÇÇ going down
- If m‚ÇÅ > m‚ÇÇ: system accelerates with m‚ÇÅ going down
- If m‚ÇÅ = m‚ÇÇ: zero net force, zero acceleration

### 3. Tension
The rope tension is always the same throughout (assuming massless rope):
- Tension is LESS than the weight of either mass
- Maximum tension occurs when masses are equal
- Formula: T = 2m‚ÇÅm‚ÇÇg/(m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ)

## üí° Tips for Students

1. **Watch the arrows**: Green (velocity) shows motion direction, orange (acceleration) shows which way velocity is changing

2. **Equal masses are special**: When masses are equal, the system is in equilibrium (or constant motion)

3. **Initial velocity matters**: The system can temporarily move "against" its acceleration

4. **Pause and observe**: Use pause to examine the vectors at any moment

5. **Try extreme values**: Experiment with very different masses or high initial velocities

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Why does mass 1 move down when mass 2 is heavier?**
A: Because you set a negative initial velocity! Acceleration will eventually reverse the motion.

**Q: Why doesn't anything move when masses are equal?**
A: With equal masses and zero initial velocity, there's no net force and no acceleration. Try adding an initial velocity!

**Q: What does "frictionless pulley" mean?**
A: It means we ignore friction and the pulley's mass. Real pulleys would behave slightly differently.

**Q: Can I use this for homework/projects?**
A: Yes! This is an educational tool. Use it to verify your calculations and understand the concepts.
