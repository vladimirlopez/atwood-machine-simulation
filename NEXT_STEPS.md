## üöÄ Next Steps: Create Your GitHub Repository

Choose one of these methods:

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended) ü§ñ

Run the setup script:
```bash
cd "/Users/vladimir.lopez/Desktop/AI/Physics Simulations/Atwood Machine"
./setup-github.sh
```

This will:
1. Check if GitHub CLI is installed
2. Create your repository
3. Push your code
4. Open the repository in your browser

### Option 2: Manual üëê

1. **Install GitHub CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   ```

2. **Authenticate with GitHub**:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **Create and push repository**:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/vladimir.lopez/Desktop/AI/Physics Simulations/Atwood Machine"
   gh repo create atwood-machine-simulation --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
   ```

### Option 3: Via GitHub Website üåê

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `atwood-machine-simulation`
3. Description: `Interactive HTML5 Atwood Machine physics simulation`
4. Choose **Public**
5. **Don't** initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"
7. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/vladimir.lopez/Desktop/AI/Physics Simulations/Atwood Machine"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atwood-machine-simulation.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

## üåê Deploy Online (GitHub Pages)

After creating your repository:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages** in your GitHub repository
2. Under "Source", select branch: **main**
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait 2-5 minutes
5. Your site will be live at:
   ```
   https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/atwood-machine-simulation/
   ```

See **DEPLOYMENT.md** for detailed instructions.

---

## üß™ Test Locally

The simulation is already open in your browser! If not:

```bash
open "/Users/vladimir.lopez/Desktop/AI/Physics Simulations/Atwood Machine/index.html"
```

Or simply double-click `index.html` in Finder.

## üéì Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Adjustable masses** (0.1 - 20 kg)
‚úÖ **Initial velocity control** (-10 to +10 m/s)
‚úÖ **Frictionless pulley** physics
‚úÖ **Real-time calculations** (acceleration, velocity, tension)
‚úÖ **Visual vectors** (velocity in green, acceleration in orange)
‚úÖ **Constant motion** demonstration when masses are equal
‚úÖ **Educational content** about Atwood machines
‚úÖ **Responsive design** (works on mobile)
‚úÖ **Clean, modern aesthetics** for educational use

---

## üéØ Key Educational Features

### 1. Direction of Motion vs Acceleration
Students can set initial velocity opposite to the calculated acceleration to see that objects can move "against" their acceleration.

**Try this**: Set m‚ÇÅ=2kg, m‚ÇÇ=3kg, v‚ÇÄ=-4m/s
- Acceleration points down for m‚ÇÇ
- But m‚ÇÅ moves down initially!
- Watch motion eventually reverse

### 2. Equilibrium with Equal Masses
When masses are equal, acceleration = 0, demonstrating Newton's First Law.

**Try this**: Set m‚ÇÅ=3kg, m‚ÇÇ=3kg, v‚ÇÄ=2m/s
- System maintains constant velocity
- No acceleration vectors appear

### 3. Real-time Physics Calculations
All values update in real-time:
- **Acceleration**: a = g(m‚ÇÇ-m‚ÇÅ)/(m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ)
- **Tension**: T = 2m‚ÇÅm‚ÇÇg/(m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ)
- **Velocity**: v = v‚ÇÄ + at
- **Position**: x = x‚ÇÄ + v‚ÇÄt + ¬Ωat¬≤

## üîß Customization Ideas

Want to extend the simulation? Here are some ideas:

1. **Add friction** to the pulley
2. **Include pulley mass** in calculations
3. **Add more masses** (three or more)
4. **Show energy graphs** (kinetic + potential)
5. **Add sound effects** for motion
6. **Create presets** for common scenarios
7. **Add measurement tools** (ruler, timer)
8. **Export data** to CSV for analysis

The code is clean and well-documented, making modifications straightforward!
